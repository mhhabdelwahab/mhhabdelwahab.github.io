        <h2><hr><a name="biography"></a>Biography</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>
                As <b> Marine Robotics Autonomy Research Lead </b> at Khalifa University Robotics Research Center, I spearhead the development of cutting-edge technologies that drive the autonomy of underwater robots. My primary focus is creating advanced localization and navigation systems that empower these robots to operate independently in challenging marine environments.

            </p>
            <p>
                With a robust background in robotics and artificial intelligence, I specialize in developing sophisticated computer vision and deep learning models tailored for underwater inspection tasks. My work integrates state-of-the-art AI techniques to enhance the robots' ability to perform precise and reliable inspections, ensuring operational efficiency and safety in various underwater applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I aim to leverage my expertise and passion for AI and robotics to solve real-world problems and create positive impacts. I have a strong research background, obtaining my PhD in Robotics (joint program from EJUST, Egypt, and Osaka University, Japan). Throughout my career, I have published multiple papers in renowned conferences and journals and received several honors and awards for my research and academic achievements.            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my research endeavors, I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, UK, demonstrating my commitment to excellence in teaching and learning. I am dedicated to mentoring the next generation of engineers and researchers, fostering an environment of innovation and academic excellence.
            </p>
            <p>
                As someone with British and Egyptian nationalities, I bring a rich cultural perspective to my work and collaborations. This unique background enhances my ability to develop innovative solutions and collaborate with diverse teams, pushing the boundaries.            </p>
