    <h1 style="margin-top: 0em">Research Focus</h1>
    Our research is centered on advancing robotic systems for real-world applications with a focus on computer vision, visual SLAM, and autonomous inspection systems. 
    We aim to push the boundaries of reliability, energy efficiency, and adaptability in robotic platforms, particularly for marine environments and industrial settings. 
    
    We specialize in integrating Building Information Modelling (BIM) with SLAM to enhance indoor navigation accuracy, 
    developing bio-inspired visual systems, and improving the energy efficiency of robotics systems through innovative algorithms.
    <br><br>
    In line with our goals, we explore two main areas: 
    <strong>Robotic Perception and SLAM</strong> and <strong>Energy-efficient and Autonomous Systems</strong>.

        <h2><hr><a name="robotic-perception"></a>Robotic Perception and SLAM</h2>
        Our work on robotic perception focuses on creating advanced solutions for autonomous navigation and scene understanding. 
        We are particularly interested in visual SLAM techniques and how they can be applied to different environments, including complex indoor and marine scenarios.

        <h2><hr><a name="energy-efficient"></a>Energy-efficient and Autonomous Systems</h2>
        We also focus on energy-efficient robotics, particularly in creating sustainable solutions for industrial inspection and marine applications. 
        The development of autonomous robots that can operate reliably over long periods with minimal energy consumption is a key priority.
        
        <h3>Autonomous Inspection Systems</h3>
        Our autonomous inspection robots are designed for use in unmanned industrial plants and offshore facilities. 
        By utilizing deep learning algorithms and advanced sensor technologies, we enable these robots to detect anomalies and ensure safe operations.
